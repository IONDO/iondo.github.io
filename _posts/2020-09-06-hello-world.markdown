Writing my first post using GitHub static pages and Jekyll accomplished! &#9989;

In case you are also interested in doing the same here are the resources I have used:

1. Installing [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/) . 

This tutorial assumes you are using a *bash* shell. 
If your shell is *zsh* instead, use the command below to enable Jekyll commands in your terminal:

```
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.gem/ruby/2.6.0/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

2. Instructions on how to [create/use](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) 
GitHub pages with Jekyll. 

That is all for the first post.

Keep on not not coding!
